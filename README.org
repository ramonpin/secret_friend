* Secret Friend and other samples

This repository contains several mini projects that we use to learn Elixir
capabilities during our workshop sessions on friday's mornings.

** Secret Friend

This is our first example. We used it to learn basics of Elixir and OTP.

** Elixir Scripting

This was used to learn how we can use Elixir as a scripting language for
simple tasks.

** Name API

In this project we implemented a simple HTTP API using Plug. Also was
out test bed for asynchronous code and failure management using the *with*
function. Also contains a struct definition in NameApi.Data.User module and
a very simple example of metaprogramming with *__using__* and *defmacro*.
